# The growing evolution of acceptance of homosexuality in the United States from 1982 to 2017

Motivated by the study of the social changes that shape the world today, this report analyses the increased acceptance of homosexuality in the United States from 1982 to 2017 based on individual characteristics. By means of a precise choice of personal characteristics which are religion, sex, age, political opinion and level of education, we will use an ordered probit econometric model to estimate the probability to accept homosexuality on the basis of it. As our results are almost all significant, this reveals a considerable importance of these personal criteria on the increasing evolution of the acceptance of homosexuality in the United States over our study period (1982 to 2017). This study therefore makes it possible to identify that it is essential to take into account personal factors in order to understand the changes of societies and consequently of our world.
